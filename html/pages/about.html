                  Hello, My name is Lauren Baez-Cuevas, my pronouns are she/her and I am a beginner programmer. I started a Intro to Web Development Program in June of 2023 through a organization named G{Code}. It is a 12 week program aimed for Black, Brown, and Indigiounous young women and non-binary people between  the ages of 18-25. It is here that I have begun my journey into the tech industry by learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I also know how to use VS Code, Codepen, Git, and  Figma.
